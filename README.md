# Empirical Frequency-Based Prime Sieve

This repository presents an alternative model for identifying prime numbers using cyclic frequency patterns, based on numbers of the form 6nÂ±1. The method includes:

- A **frequency-based sieve** for generating prime lists
- A **predictive primality checker** that works without generating any list
- Verification tools to compare results with classical methods (like `sympy`)

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

```
frequency_sieve_package/
â”œâ”€â”€ predictive_checker/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ predictive_primality_en.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ predictive_checker_colab_en.ipynb

    â”œâ”€â”€ verified_sieve_colab_en.ipynb
    â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

Each folder contains:
- A Python module (`.py`) with the core logic
- A Colab-ready notebook (`.ipynb`) that demonstrates its use
- A local README with usage instructions

---

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

The notebooks depend on:

- Python 3.x
- `sympy` (for verification in `prime_sieve_verification`)

> These can be used directly in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) by uploading the required `.py` file when prompted.

---

## âœ… Validation

The frequency-based sieve has been validated against official prime lists (e.g., via `sympy`) and passes all correctness tests up to large bounds (e.g., 10,000).
