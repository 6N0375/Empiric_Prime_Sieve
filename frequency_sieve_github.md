## Frequency Sieve: A Model for Primality Analysis

### Introduction

This document presents an alternative model for primality testing, based on the elimination of composite numbers through "frequencies" generated from base prime numbers. The model avoids direct factorization and is founded on cyclic patterns associated with numbers of the form $ 6N \pm 1 $, which are the only candidates for primes greater than 3.

The method was developed through empirical observation and validated with computational tools. This formulation aims to use formal and technical language, suitable for future academic evaluation.

### I. Theoretical Foundation

#### 1. Candidate prime numbers

Every prime number greater than 3 can be expressed as $ 6N \pm 1 $. These are referred to as **base numbers** or **potential primes**:

$$ 	ext{General base: } p = 6N - 1 \quad 	ext{or} \quad p = 6N + 1 $$

These numbers are listed in increasing order and assigned a relative position in the sequence (e.g., position 1, 2, 3... according to their appearance as $ 6N \pm 1 $).

#### 2. Frequencies

For each known prime number, two columns of frequencies are generated, denoted here as **frequency 1** and **frequency 2**. These represent values that, when iteratively summed with multiples of a cycle, generate periodic patterns that eliminate composites.

**Frequency 1**:
Generated by adding the cycle $ C $ to an initial value associated with the base prime:

$$ f_1 = a + kC $$

**Frequency 2**:
Complementarily, two values close to the base prime are generated as follows:

$$ f_2^- = C - 1, \quad f_2^+ = C + 1 $$

Then, iterated with multiples of the cycle:

$$ f_2 = f_2^-, f_2^+ + mC $$

In practice, these are built using multiples of 4 to generate such pairs. The pattern repeats with each new base number.

#### 3. Cancellation through frequencies

Each frequency acts like a "trace" that steps through and eliminates positions in the list. If a frequency lands on a candidate prime, it is considered **composite**. A single collision is enough to discard primality.

This idea stems from visual observations where patterns were seen to cyclically restart after reaching products like $ 5 	imes 7 	imes 11 	imes \ldots $.

#### 4. Application range

Frequencies generated for each base prime $ p $ are only applied from $ p+1 $ to $ p^2 $. This range ensures there is no interference from future patterns or premature cancellations.

### II. Evaluation Method

To determine whether a number $ n $ is prime, follow this procedure:

1. Verify that $ n $ is of the form $ 6N \pm 1 $.
2. Generate all frequencies corresponding to primes less than $ \sqrt{n} $.
3. Apply the frequencies as iterative steps and check whether any collide with $ n $.
4. If at least one collision exists, the number is **composite**. If none of the frequencies hit $ n $, it is considered **prime**.

This technique can be expressed computationally as a prediction system using **offsets**. An offset determines how many times a frequency would reach the target number:

$$ 	ext{offset} = rac{n - f}{C} $$

If the result is an integer, it implies that the frequency lands on the number, and thus it is composite.

### III. Conclusion

The frequency sieve offers an alternative approach to primality testing without relying on division or factorization. Although it originated from empirical observation, its results match those of the Sieve of Eratosthenes. The offset-based prediction provides a computational advantage and can be efficiently automated.

This document intentionally excludes references to spreadsheet development and focuses solely on the mathematical and theoretical formulation of the model.
